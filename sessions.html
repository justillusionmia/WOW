                                    Today is the first WOW session and we had to split up into groups of 
                                    10 to get to know more each other. Then we had to choose one person to 
                                    present on behalf of our group and share with the year group some things 
                                    that we remember about each other.

                                    The first session was a good chance to introduce one another. Splitting 
                                    into groups allowed us to share personal stories and learn about each other's interests. 
                                    I found it interesting to hear what others remembered about me, which 
                                    helped me understand how I am perceived by others.

                                that doing what I love can lead to a fulfilling life. The 4 P's provided a

                                reminder that integrity should always guide our actions, no matter the
                                field we choose and that we should be more knowledgable about our surroundings. 
                                The crossword puzzle reinforced  key concepts about cars and made learning more fun.

                                Learning about mental health was both enlightening and necessary. Understanding 
                                how the brain works helped in understanind why we feel certain emotions and react
                                in specific ways. The discussion on ACEs highlighted the long-term impact of 
                                childhood experiences on mental health. The TED Talk was particularly moving and 
                                emphasized the importance of breaking down stigma surrounding mental health issues.

                                It highlighted several foods to avoid for a healthier lifestyle, 
                                including liquid sugar, pasteurized cheese, protein bars, etc. 
                                We also learned about moringa a nutrient-rich plant that offers 
                                several health benefits. This session has inspired me to take a 
                                closer look at what I eat and try to find a healthier relationship with food.

                                Learning about the E's of road safety made it clear that, 
                                when it comes to lowering accidents, education is just as 
                                important as enforcement. Although straightforward, the rules 
                                for crossing streets were necessary for ensuring safety. I 
                                value the fact that this session not only educated us but

                                One of the most helpful seminars we've had so far was this one on first aid 
                                and CPR training. Someone's life can be seriously changed by knowing
                                how to react in an emergency. The real-world demonstrartion reinforced 
                                the techniques we learned and made them easier to remember. I now feel more 
                                confident in my ability to help others in challenging situations because of 
                                this session.

                                The sharing circle we did today was really intense and it encouraged 
                                us to be vulnerable and trust one another. By talking about 
                                stress-related emotions, we were able to realize that we are 
                                not the only ones that face difficulties. Hearing other people 
                                talk about their experiences was reassuring and contributed to 
                                the supportive mood. I learned from this session how important it 
                                is to talk openly about mental health and to get help when I need it.

                                impactful and made us feel validated. We also talked about how men and women 
                                have different relationship goals. Males tend to prioritize physical attraction 
                                first, while women tend to prefer emotional support. Learning about love languages 
                                also helped me understand different expressions of affection.

                                to volunteer to help these organizations assist others and give back 
                                to the community. Understanding how giving back can promote community 
                                growth inspired me to get involved in local projects. I realized 
                                that community service is not just about helping others, it is also about
                                forming relationships and learning about different people.

                                Toaday we walked about sexual health and gender identity and it was
                                really informative. I was able to clarify some of my assumptions 
                                after learning about the difference between gender and biological 
                                sex. The importance of understanding these topics for future healthy
                                relationships was stressed a lot in this session.

                                in our lives was started by the this session on AI versus 
                                Us. It got me thinking about how, when applied properly, 
                                AI could improve human capabilities rather than take their place. 
                                I'm excited to find out how AI may help me accomplish my goals while 
                                still being myself.

                                We then made Valentine's day cards which was really enjoyable because I 
                                was able to write messages to those who mean the most to me.

                                At this WOW session, a representative from Trent University in 
                                Canada came to tell us a about their campus and some of the courses they offer. 
                                He stressed on the small class sizes and personalized learning 
                                experience and said that it makes it an excellent choice for students seeking a more 
                                intimate educational environment. Some of my classmates were 
                                interested in the university's co-op programs, which provide hands-on 
                                experience and opportunities in various fields. At the end of the session, 
                                we had the opportunity to ask questions, and some people were excited about 
                                the possibility of studying at Trent University. The representative handed out 
                                brochures and encouraged us to visit the university's website for more 
                                information on application deadline and scholarships.

                                            Today at WOW the University of the West Indies came to talk to us about
                                            their programs and requirements to get in. The presenter came with 5 students who
                                            are in their last year of UWI and they were able to answer our questions from their point of view.
                                            Two of the students actually went to sixth form and are working as students at UWI. The presenter
                                            also gave us his business card and told us we can contact him anytime to find out more information.
                                            He also invited us to the UWI open tour that they are having on the 5th and 6th of April. Overall I liked
                                            this session because we were able to get more information on scholarships and bursaries which are really
                                            competative to get.

                                At today's session we had a presenter named Malika Shade-holder who came to tell us about
                                networking and using LinkedIn. She introduced us to the useful tool of SWOT analysis to determine our
                                strengths and weaknesses and emphasized the importance of confidence in determining our career goals.
                                She also gave us tips on what information should be found on a resume to keep it perofessional and make it stand
                                out to job interviewers. We also learned about networking and how listening is just as important as speaking when trying to
                                form connections. I think this session was a good was to wrap up all the sessions by teaahing us teh first step to enter into the World of Work.
